  contents:
    - title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
      items: 
        - Proposed several frameworks aiding global value function factorization in multi-agent reinforcement learning, including deep variational information bottleneck method, utlizing counterfactual assitive information and optimal prioritized experience replay. 
        - Evaluated the proposed method on the several challenging benchmarks including StarCraft II challenge and demonstrated a substantial performance improvement.
        - Several papers are published in NeurIPS, AAMAS and IEEE-TETCI.
    - title: Optimizations in Distributed Learning
      items:
        - Proposed an optimization algorithm and conducted convergence analysis on Federated Learning with heterogeneous local clients. 
        - Validated the proposed theory on several datasets and provided remarks on designing algorithms of heterogeneous federated learning. 
        - The initial work is accepted at FL-NeurIPS 2022 for oral presentation (~5%).
    - title: Cyber and Software Security
      items: 
      - Conducted software security testing using {AFL}-based fuzzing tools on communication protocols like SSL and proposed a machine-learning-based privacy-preserving app for Android using the Xposed framework. 
      - Studied the occurrence of concurrent bugs in JavaScript inside the WebKit engine, and proposed a framework that generates critical conditions to promote the reproduction of concurrency-related bugs within limited execution overhead, the work is accepted at CCS FEAST 2020.
