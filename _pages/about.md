## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

This is Hanhan, currently a 4-th year Ph.D student at the department of [ECE](https://www.ece.seas.gwu.edu/), [the George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) advised by [Prof.Tian Lan](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~tlan/) in the Lab for Intelligent Networking and Computing. I'm interested in **reinforcement learing**, **federated learning** and **generative models**. 

Specifically my past research includes multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, heterogeneous distributed learning algorithms and optimization, software security and offline-reinforcement learing via sequence generative modeling.

[I'm on the job market! Please feel free to contact me if you think I'm a good fit for a position you know, thank you!](#)

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
