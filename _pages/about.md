## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

This is Hanhan, currently a final year Ph.D student at the department of [ECE](https://www.ece.seas.gwu.edu/), [the George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) in the Lab for Intelligent Networking and Computing. I'm fortunate and grateful to be advised by [Prof.Tian Lan](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~tlan/) and worked with Prof.[Vaneet Aggarwal](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~vaneet/) and Prof.[Guru Venkataramani](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~guruv/). I'm interested in **Reinforcement Learing**, **Federated Learning** and **Generative Models**. 

My research endeavors have predominantly centered around the design and optimization of decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. This work entails the development of sophisticated methodologies for coordinating agent actions in complex environments without centralized control. Additionally, I have explored the application of reinforcement learning in the domain of network resource allocation to enhance efficiency and performance in distributed systems.

Furthermore, my academic pursuits have included the investigation of heterogeneous federated learning algorithms and their optimizations. In this topic, my focus has been on the optimization of these algorithms to address the challenges posed by the nature of heterogeneous models in distributed environments.

Lastly, my research portfolio also encompasses the domain of offline reinforcement learning, with a particular focus on utilizing sequence generative modeling. This area of study involves the development of generative models that can effectively learn from datasets without interaction with the environment, an approach that holds substantial promise for advancing the field of reinforcement learning by mitigating the dependency on extensive online data collection.

[Please feel free to contact me if you think I'm a good fit for a position you know or would like to collaborate on research projects, thank you!](#)

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
